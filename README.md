# AWS Cloud Resume Challenge

Hey there, I'm thrilled to share my experience with the Cloud Resume Challenge! It provided an excellent opportunity to put my acquired skills into practice hands-on.

Throughout this challenge, I utilized:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS) as my primary hosting service. I leveraged AWS services such as Amazon S3 to store all website code, DynamoDB for a NoSQL database to manage views count, a Python-based Lambda function to trigger and modify the DynamoDB table, IAM for proper permission assignments, and finally CloudFront to expose the website to the internet, linked via this unique DNS: https://d1pgm2o9u4m14n.cloudfront.net.
- Git and GitHub for project version control and collaboration.
- GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), automating the build pipelines.
- Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IAC), enabling efficient management and provisioning of cloud resources.

It was an enriching experience that strengthened my understanding of cloud technologies and their practical applications. Looking forward to leveraging these skills in future projects and opportunities!
