# AWS Cloud Resume Challenge

Hey there, this is my attempt for the cloud resume challenge in AWS.

Throughout this challenge, I utilized:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS) as my primary hosting service. I leveraged AWS services such as Amazon S3 to store all website code, DynamoDB for a NoSQL database to manage views count, a Python-based Lambda function to trigger and modify the DynamoDB table, IAM for proper permission assignments, and finally CloudFront to expose the website to the internet, linked via this unique DNS: https://d1pgm2o9u4m14n.cloudfront.net.
- Git and GitHub for project version control and collaboration.
- GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), automating the build pipelines.
- Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IAC), enabling efficient management and provisioning of cloud resources.
